# Backbone ThIWert
An AKO Project by Gin Havana and AssiKalle

## I. Planning:
1. Goal:  
The goal is to create a stable network radio connection from the HS-Nordhausen to the ThiWert.

1.1. Conditions and requirements:  
1.1.1. Main consideration:
- Choosing mounting location
  - [ ] Which building? Options are building 18, 19 and ThIWert
  - [ ] Wall height, width
  - [ ] Which floor exactly
- Budget, cost
  - [ ] Maximum budget number
  - [ ] Number of devices needed
- Time
  - Presumably 2 months
  - [ ] Ask for time limit
- Quality requirement
  - Presumably the connection is flawlessly
  - The reliability and a high speed are main issues.
  - [ ] Detail expectation, e.g. bandwidth, etc.
1.1.2. Sub demand and condition:
- Weather condition
- Obstacle between to access points

1.2. Risks:
- Low budget or hardware has high cost
- In practice it will take more time than limited/expected time
- No suitable mounting point
- Malfunction hardware or inconfigurable software technology
- Bad weather
- To many obstacles interrupting signal
- tbd due to multiple attempts if fail

1.3. Consequences:
- How willing is the client to take risks?
- What if the project is unsuccessful?

1.4. Expectation:
- tbd

1.5. Contact details:  
  1. ThIWert:
     - Prof. Ariane Ruff
     - Admin* Mark Gassmann
  2. Medienzentrum:
     - Fred Wagner
  3. Supervisor:
     - Prof. Dr.-Ing. Thomas HÃ¼hn

2. Rough planning:
- [x] Distance estimation and calculation and in practice (via Google Earth)
- [x] Height difference (via Google Earth)
- [x] Look for obstacle theoretically
- [ ] Check weather condition
- [ ] Have a meeting to research about conditions and requirements as well as demands
- [ ] Topographic survey
- [ ] Research about routing device that fits budget
- [ ] tbd

3. Detail planning:
- [ ] Research for obstacles e.g. trees or buildings that blocking the direct signal. Can be done by measuring on Google Earth.
- [ ] tbd

## II. Implementation:
1. Condition research:  
Due to known information, there are two variants from which the antenna(s) can be installed. They are building 18 and building 19. Distance will be measured from south side of both buildings, since ThIWert main building ist positioned southern from Campus, and from north side of ThIWert main building. Assuming that installation points can be roughly on the southern wall of buildings 18 and 19 and on northern wall of ThIWert building, the measured/estimated distances via Google Earth are:

|Distance from H18|Distance from H19|Height difference
| - | - | - |
|1.37 ~ 1.41 km|1.35 ~ 1.39 km|10 ~ 11 m|

There is low chance of any posible obstacle blocking signal.
