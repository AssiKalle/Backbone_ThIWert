2.1. Main consideration:
- Choosing mounting location
  - [ ] Which building? Options are building 18, 19 and ThIWert
  - [ ] Wall height, width
  - [ ] Which floor exactly
- [ ] Distance estimation and calculation and in practice (via Google Earth)
- [ ] Height difference (via Google Earth)
- Budget, cost
  - [ ] Maximum budget number
- Time
  - Presumably 2 months
  - [ ] Ask for time limit
- Quality requirement
  - Presumably the connection is flawlessly
  - [ ] Detail expectation, e.g. bandwidth, etc.
2.2. Sub demand and condition:
- Weather condition
- Obstacle between to access points

3. Risks:
- Low budget
- In practice it will take more time than limited/expected time
- No suitable mounting point
- Malfunction hardware or inconfigurable software technology
- Bad weather
- To many obstacles interrupting signal
- tbd due to multiple attempts if fail

4. Consequences:
- How willing is the client to take risks?
