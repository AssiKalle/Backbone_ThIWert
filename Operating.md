## 3. Operating:
### 1. First attempt day January 24th 2022:
1. Installation in ThIWert (A good provision):  
The appointment meeting for mounting atempt is 8 am and it is expected to take 1 to 2 hour(s) to finish. Two antennas, each for different bandwidth 
After arriving at ThIWert and on the roof, it is required that we recheck the photos for estimated signal direction. Thomas has suggested that we choose the closer edge of the entrance to Campus direction as first mounting option, which is 380cm away from the entrance. Thomas has also help with the drilling through a 27cm thick wall to set up the antenna holder and a way for 2 testing cables to go through.

After fixing the antenna holder, 2 antennas are mounted where the 5GHz is set below and the 60GHz is set above.

Signal direction is estimated by placing one head of the drill fix on the antenna holder and pointing the other head following the pre-estimated direction with Google Earth.

After plugging in the two cables, Thomas set up the position
