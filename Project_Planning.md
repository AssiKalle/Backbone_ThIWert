# Backbone ThIWert

## Rough Planning:
1. Distance measuring/estimating via Google Earth
2. Posible obstacles and terrains research
3. Topographic survey
4. Research about routing device that fits budget

## Detailed Planning:
Due to known information, there are two variants from which the antenna(s) can be installed. They are building 18 and building 19. Distance will be measured from south side of both buildings, since ThIWert main building ist positioned southern from Campus, and from north side of ThIWert main building. Assuming that installation points can be roughly on the southern wall of buildings 18 and 19 and on northern wall of ThIWert building, the measured/estimated distances via Google Earth are:

|18|19|
| - | - |
|1.37 ~ 1.41 km|1.35 ~ 1.39 km|

The height difference is roughly 10 ~ 11 m. There is low chance of any posible obstacle blocking signal.

Topographic survey occur on Monday October 25th to search for available mounting points.
