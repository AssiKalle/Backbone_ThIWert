# Backbone ThIWert

## Rough Planning:
1. Distance measuring/estimating via Google Earth
2. Topographic survey
3. Research about routing device that fits budget

## Detailed Planning:
- Due to known information, there are two variants from which the antenna(s) can be installed. They are building 18 and building 19.
- Distance will be measured from south side of both buildings, since ThIWert main building ist positioned southern from Campus, and from north side of ThIWert main building.
- Assuming that installation points can be roughly on the southern wall of buildings 18 and 19 and on northern wall of ThIWert building, the measured/estimated distances via Google Earth are:

|18|19|
| - | - |
|1.37 ~ 1.41 km|1.35 ~ 1.39 km|

- Topographic survey occure on Monday October 25th to search for available mounting points.
